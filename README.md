### I created my GitHub account last year. Microsoft now owns GitHub. GitHub is GUI for Git -in CLI  only- initially created by Linus Torvald.
#### The repository created is the website I worked on this semester. It contains all the necessary HTML, CSS, and asset files necessary for its operation
##### First step was login into GitHub and create an online repository with a README.md file. Then I installed GitHub Desktop and logged into my account. Then I pulled the repository initially created in online GitHub, down to desktop GitHub. Following that, I copy pasted the files from my website folder into a folder of the newly created desktop repository. I wrote a summary and committed changes. After that, I pushed the contents of the local repository to the online GitHub repository. Pretty simple. This action made my website available online for the whole world to see. Now you can access my website at this link: https://milosrad22.github.io/index.html
# Thank you, and I hope you enjoy my website!
